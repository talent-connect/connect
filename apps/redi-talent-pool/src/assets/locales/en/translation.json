Update your profile to be as complete as possible and 4. Mentees (students) can now see the mentor profiles, they look for the ones that fit best and start applying to mentors. Mentors wait for applications. When they receive an application they let the student know as soon as possible if they are ReDI for this mentorship relationship."

In those personal meetings with Miriam or one of her colleagues, we like to get to know everyone better and become an understanding of the motivation to be with us. It helps to achieve 'using technology to break down barriers and connect the leaders of tomorrow.'"

If you prefer one, apply to that one first and wait for an answer. If you do not get an answer soon, or have found multiple good options, apply to 3 or 4 mentors."

(1,5 or 2 hours seems to be a good time to get something done). The meetings can be scheduled whenever you want to. We just would like you to document all meetings on the ReDI Connect platform."

            "answer": "For your first meeting you can focus on getting to know each other and work on setting goals together. Some students already have clear long term goals. In those cases, you can think carefully about concrete, realistic goals for the next 6 months that bring you closer to your long term goals. However, a lot of students are not sure how to move forward, in which area to specialize or how to find about realistic opportunities for the upcoming years. In these cases, your goals can be to gain insights into one or a few specialization areas, or which skills are best to focus on developing further. For more specific guidelines check out the session guidelines."

            "answer": "There can be different reasons for having the feeling the mentorship should not continue. And that is totally okay. You can then use the option to contact Miriam on your mentorship dashboard. Miriam and her colleagues will help you find a solution, solving problems or finding another mentor. It’s all better than staying with a mentor you don’t want to meet."
          },

            "question": "What should I do if my mentee has any issues I can’t / am not qualified to resolve?",
