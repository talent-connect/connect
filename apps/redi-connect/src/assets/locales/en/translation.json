          {
            "question": "What is ReDI’s definition of mentorship?",
            "answer": "A definition that some ReDI mentors came up with is the following: “A mentor is a trusted sparring partner for the mentee whose task is to provide more or less structured guidance for the mentee’s individual development and learning process by empowering the mentee to learn about and to gain control over their very own resources. Although goals are very individual on a concrete level, a general goal of mentorship could be summed up as enabling the mentee to better cope with their topics using their own resources in the future.”"
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I get started?",
            "answer": "Follow these four steps: 1. Fill in the sign-up form to provide some first information on your ReDI Connect profile. 2. Prospective mentors will meet Miriam and future mentees will meet Paulina, so we can get to know you better and activate your profile. 3. Complete your profile as much as possible to allow for a great match. 4. Mentees (students) can now browse through the available mentor profiles. They look for the ones that best fit their needs and start applying to mentors. Mentors wait for applications. When they receive an application, they let the student know as soon as possible, whether they are ReDI for this mentorship match."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why do I have to meet with Miriam or Paulina before I can start?",
            "answer": "At ReDI we like to keep a close community spirit and create a welcoming and safe space for everyone. This means that we like to know everyone personally. In these personal meetings with Miriam or Paulina, we like to get to know you better and get an understanding of your motivation to be a part of ReDI Connect. This way we hope to realize our credo of 'using technology to break down barriers and connect the leaders of tomorrow.'"
          },
          {
            "question": "How much time does the mentorship require?",
            "answer": "We suggest a mentorship duration for about 4-6 months. If needed, it can be longer. In the end, it is up to you and your mentor/mentee to decide how often you want to meet. It highly depends on the goals that you are trying to reach and the time commitment each party is able to make. Being prepared for your sessions is also important, so please keep that in mind."
          },
          {
            "question": "How can I create a good profile?",
            "answer": "Share all the information that might be relevant to allow the other person to check whether it will be a good match. Be as specific as possible about what you want to accomplish together. Share your professional and education info, as well as something personal about you (only what you feel comfortable sharing). Uploading a photo may give others an idea of who you are and creates trust."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does the matching process work?",
            "answer": "Everyone on ReDI Connect creates a profile with information about them. However, only the mentees are able to see the mentors’ profiles, not the other way around. Mentees browse mentor profiles and apply to the ones that have the expertise or experience they need. Only once a mentor receives an application, they will see that person’s profile. Mentors review applications from mentees and decide if they can help them based on the student’s profile and application message. Once a mentor accepts an application, it’s a match!"

          {
            "question": "Who can become a mentor?",
            "answer": "Anyone who has expertise or experience our students can learn from. We have a wide range of volunteer mentors: programmers, engineers, designers, HR professionals, entrepreneurs, marketing specialists, data scientists or also advanced students."
          },
          {
            "question": "Am I ReDI to become a mentor?",
            "answer": "If you are unsure, don’t worry, you can always sign up and schedule a call with Miriam to learn more about the program and decide together if it is a good time for you to become a mentor."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I pick the mentoring topics in my profile?",
            "answer": "The mentoring topics show your prospective mentee which areas you can support them in. Please choose the ones that you feel comfortable and confident enough to be mentoring our students/alumni on. You can select as many as you want, but you may want to focus on the ones that best reflect your skills, expertise and focus you want to give your mentorship relationship. Be aware that mentees can only select up to four mentoring topics to reflect their most urgent support needs."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I get matched with a mentee?",
            "answer": "Make sure your profile reflects your expertise and then lean back and wait for applications by mentees. Once you receive an application, you will get an email notification and be able to read it on the ReDI Connect platform. Then you can decide whether you will be able to help this student and answer them as soon as possible. In case you think you are not a good match, please explain to the student why you think you are not the best match for them, so they can look for someone else. Please know that sometimes it can also take a bit longer until you receive an application, so be patient."
          },
          {
            "question": "How can I update or improve my profile?",
            "answer": "Go to 'My profile' and share some more info about yourself. A photo is usually also a good way to gain more traction. For our students, it is important to get an idea of who you are, what it is like to collaborate with you and how you might be able to help them. Adding some personal info also creates trust and connection. If you have a portfolio, you can also share your github or a link to your other portfolio."
          },
          {
            "question": "How to stop receiving further applications?",
            "answer": "Please go to your profile page and check your mentee count capacity. If it is currently too high for you, please edit it. If you want to take a break from mentoring for a while, you can set your mentee count capacity to '0'. This will make your profile invisible and you will not receive any applications."
          },
          {
            "question": "What to do if my mentee comes to me with issues I am not qualified to answer?",
            "answer": "If your mentee comes to you with any serious issues not related to the scope of the mentorship relationship (e.g. skill-building or job search), please contact us at <a href='mailto:career@redi-school.org'>career@redi-school.org</a> or <a href='mailto:miriam@redi-school.org'>miriam@redi-school.org</a>. Please, do not try to resolve psychological or financial issues yourself. We are also in close contact with Ipso, an organization offering online psychosocial counselling, and are happy to connect them with your mentee."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is there a way to meet the ReDI Connect Community?",
            "answer": "Yes! Usually in advance of the new semester, we organize info sessions for prospective ReDI volunteers. Please join our ReDI School groups on MeetUp to be informed of the latest events.</br></br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/ReDI-school/' target='_blank'>ReDI School Berlin</a></br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/Tech-Talks-Hosted-by-ReDI-School-Munich/' target='_blank'>ReDI School Munich</a></br><a href='https://www.meetup.com/ReDI-School-NRW/' target='_blank'>ReDI School NRW</a></br></br>Once you are a mentor with ReDI, you will also be informed of all upcoming events and workshops on our dedicated mentor slack channel and our LinkedIn group."

            "question": "Why could I need a mentor?",
            "answer": "Having a mentor can have many different benefits: it is a great way to gain insight into the tech industry, get a clearer view of what your next career steps could be after ReDI School, learn how to present yourself on your CV and during job interviews, and get that extra help on topics related to your ReDI course. Everyone can benefit from having a mentor!"
          },

            "question": "Am I ready to get a mentor?",
            "answer": "If you are not sure, whether it is the right time for you to get a mentor, just sign up and schedule a meeting with Paulina . She will discuss with you the best options for you at this stage. Setting your professional goals will help you decide which are the more relevant areas where you would like to to have some support during your mentoring sessions."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I find the right mentor?",
            "answer": "Make sure your profile reflects your needs and explains what you would like to get out of the mentorship. When looking for mentor profiles, use the filters to see the most relevant profiles. If you are still unsure which mentor to contact, you can also reach out to Miriam (<a href='mailto:miriam@redi-school.org'>miriam@redi-school.org</a>) to check out together which mentor could be a good fit."
          },
          {
            "question": "What happens after I've sent an application?",
            "answer": "The mentor will receive an email notification about your application. Hopefully they will review it soon and give you an answer. If you do not receive an answer within a week, please let us know, so we can follow up. You may also choose to apply to another mentor that meets your criteria."
          },
          {
            "question": "How many applications should I send?",
            "answer": "Generally, you can always only have one mentor at a time. You can apply to multiple mentors at the same time, but be aware that the first one to accept will be your mentor. If you find one that you think could be a really good match, apply to that one first and wait for an answer. If you do not get an answer soon, try the next best match."
          },
          {
            "question": "How can I update or improve my profile?",
            "answer": "Go to ReDI Connect to work on ‘My profile’ and share some more info about yourself. Make sure your information is accurate and as complete as possible. The more you share about yourself, the easier it is for a mentor to see if and how they can help you. Also a photo of yourself can create  trust and connection. If you already have a portfolio, you can also share your github or a link to your other portfolio."

          },
          {
            "question": "What tools to use to communicate?",
            "answer": "This is up to the mentee and mentor to decide. You can indicate a preference in your profile or discuss in your first session which communication tool to use. You could for example also use our ReDI Slack space to communicate since most of our community is there."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is there a location where we could meet?",
            "answer": "Due to the Covid-19 situation, we currently recommend using online tools to meet and communicate with each other. If you both agree and reside in the same location, you may also choose to meet up - while complying with local regulations."
          },
          {
            "question": "How often and for how long should we meet?",
            "answer": "We recommend a minimum of 6 sessions in a period of about 6 months, 1 hour each time. However, a lot of people meet more often and usually for more than an hour. (1,5 - 2 hours seems to be a good time to get something done). The meetings can be scheduled whenever you want to. We just ask mentors to log all meetings on the ReDI Connect platform."
          },
          {
            "question": "How can we structure our mentoring sessions?",
            "answer": "For your first meeting you can focus on getting to know each other and work on setting goals together. Some students already have clear long-term goals. In these cases, you can think carefully about concrete, realistic goals for the next 6 months that bring you closer to your long-term goals. Other students are not sure yet about how to move forward, in which area to specialize or how to find realistic opportunities for the upcoming years. In those cases, your mentorship goals can be to gain insights into one or a few specialization areas, or to determine the best skills to develop further. For more specific guidance, mentors can reach out and learn from other mentors using the Slack space or the regular mentors’ gatherings. There is also a shared folder on our ReDI Community drive with links to resources and other useful guidance."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does the mentorship match end?",
            "answer": "When both mentor and mentee think that they have reached their mentorship goals or feel that the match isn’t a good fit anymore, the mentor can mark the mentorship as complete on the ‘My mentorship’ page. Since this is a relationship between mentor and mentee, we ask you to communicate with each other, if and when you would like to complete the mentorship. Don’t worry about offending anyone. It is completely normal and even makes sense that at some point, when the goals have been achieved, the mentorship ends. This way you will both be able to be matched again with someone else. In the rare case that one party doesn’t feel comfortable, please refer to the next point below."
          },
          {
            "question": "What to do if the mentorship match doesn't feel right?",
            "answer": "There can be different reasons for having the feeling the mentorship should not continue. And this is totally okay. You can then use the option to contact Miriam or Paulina on your mentorship dashboard. The ReDI team will help you find a solution or a new match. It’s all better than staying in a mentorship relationship that doesn’t feel right or has come to an end. "
